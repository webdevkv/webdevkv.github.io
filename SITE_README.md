# Minimal portfolio site

This repository contains a very small, fast-loading single-page portfolio scaffold optimized for freelance e-commerce work.

Files added
- `index.html` — single-page site with Hero, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact
- `assets/styles.css` — tiny responsive stylesheet

Quick edits
- Replace "Your Name" and `yourname@example.com` in `index.html`.
- Replace the Formspree endpoint in the contact form: `https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id`.

Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (root).

Notes
- No JS frameworks, no external CSS libs — keeps the site fast and simple.
- If you'd like, I can update copy, add screenshots, or wire a real Formspree/Calendly link.
